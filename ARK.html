        <h1>key points of base defence</h1>
        <h4>the crouch point </h4>    
        <p>The most important part of a good defendable cave is the crouch point. it is a choke point for the enamy who is trying to raid you. It also slows the enamy because they have crouch to get through the crouch point.</p>
